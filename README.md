# homework-1 - Code Refractor
### Tasked with the overall goal of leaving code cleaner than I found it, I made multiple edits and consolidation efforts to the following HTML and CSS files to allow for easier comprehension and accessability.

# HTML Edits
Added Favicon and "Welcome to Horiseon" title.

Added "content" and "aside" tags to distinguish portion of webpage.

Added alt tags to the content images to increase accessibility.

Found that the "Search Engine Optimization" link in the navigation bar wasn't working correctly, added ID tag to fix this.

# CSS Edits

Added "contentstyle", "contentstyle img", and "contentstyle h2" class to the "content" that contained consolidated specs of 3 previously individual class tags with the same specs

Added "benefit-specs", "benefit-specs img", and "benefit-specs h3" class to the "aside" that contained consolidated specs of 3 previously individual class tags with the same specs
